# Java-FileHandler-EmailSender-Program
A project to create member lists in Java and send e-mails to the people in the relevant lists.
The project includes file operations such as creating file, file i/o and sending e-mail.

Lists are divided into "Elit Üyeler" and "Genel Üyeler" and these lists are saved in a '.txt' file where the project is located.
You can add or remove members to lists and send emails to one or both of them these list.
In order to send mail, you need to fill in the Mail address and SMTP password fields.
